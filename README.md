# ONLYOFFICE app for Jira Cloud

This is an integration solution that allows Jira Cloud users to work with office documents directly from the Jira
interface using ONLYOFFICE Docs editors. The project provides preview, editing, creation, and collaboration features
for documents, presentations, and spreadsheets, as well as protection and security for file transfer and storage.

## Features
* View and edit documents (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, etc.), presentations, and spreadsheets directly in a Jira issue.
* Co-edit documents in real-time: use two co-editing modes (Fast and Strict), Track Changes, comments, and built-in chat.
* Create new files directly from Jira using ONLYOFFICE (new documents, tables, presentations).

Supported formats:
See [ONLYOFFICE Docs Atlassian Remote -> Supported Formats](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docs-atlassian-remote/remote?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-formats)

## Requirements
